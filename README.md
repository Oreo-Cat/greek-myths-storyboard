## 🔮 What is this?

> **Greek Myths Storyboard** is an interactive, React-powered knowledge graph that maps Greek mythology as an infinite-scrollable web of stories, characters, events, and fate-loops.

Built collaboratively between me and **Jake — a GPT AI code assisstant**, this project is designed to be:

- 🧭 **Explorable**: Tap into any myth and follow sub-stories as deeply as you wish.
- 🧩 **Interconnected**: Stories aren't isolated — they’re threaded by cause, timeline, character, and theme.
- 📚 **Educational**: Dive into lore with high-context `details`, `summary`, and recursive `subBoard` systems.
- 🔁 **Recursive**: Myths can contain myths — infinitely nested knowledge structures.
